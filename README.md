# Rekrut
<p> Rekrut is a chrome extension that will help a person scrape a linkedin profile by visiting. Works automatically. Just visit the profile page.
</p>
<p>
The extension makes use of material design as well as my own css customizations.
This currenly a work in progress. I have so far been able to scrape headline and experience section of linkedin.</p>
<p>The code strives to not rely much on css but rather the DOM content of the page. I am scraping content by accessing sections that are supposedly going to stay with class names for a long time so if linkedin decides to change their website drastically only then will the DOM content change and that will not happen in a year or two. </p> But I will be on the lookout to change the code if circumstances call for it
