# Rekrut

Rekrut is a chrome extension that automatically scraps a [linkedin](www.linkedin.com) profile and can be used by recruiters of companies
to extract important details from a profile and store it in their recruitment database.  
Current version is 3.0

## Installation or Setting Up

You need to ensure that you have the following dependencies installed within your system:
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) : Ensure this is in path.  
* [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center) : Ensure the mongodb is properly installed and it is accessible through shell.  

[Clone](https://github.com/DrakenWan/Rekrut/archive/master.zip) this git folder into a suitable place in your system. Extract the folder out. Go to the [testing]() folder (It is recommended that you separate this folder from its root and place it somewhere else. It will cause overhead when you load the extension into google chrome as the extension. This is why I recommend it.)
<code>npm init</code>  
To install all the internal dependencies run: <code>npm install</code> (Keep pressing enter until it reaches the end of the description of the installation)  


## 3.0

are able to access the extension's main feature.
